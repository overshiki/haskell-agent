# MCP OAuth authorization

Remote Streamable HTTP MCP servers can require OAuth 2.1 authorization. The
harness implements the client side of the MCP authorization specification
(revision 2026-07-28): protected resource metadata discovery, authorization
server metadata discovery with issuer validation, PKCE, client registration,
scope selection, RFC 8707 resource indicators, and RFC 9207 issuer validation
of the authorization response.

## Logging in

```
monad-cli mcp login https://example.com/mcp
monad-cli mcp login https://example.com/mcp --scope files:write
monad-cli mcp logout https://example.com/mcp
```

`--scope` (repeatable) requests additional scopes for step-up authorization;
they are unioned with the scopes already granted for the same issuer. A `403`
with `insufficient_scope` during a session names the missing scope in its
error message.

`mcp login` runs the interactive browser flow:

1. An unauthenticated JSON-RPC request is sent to the MCP endpoint. The
   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer ...` challenge of the `401` response supplies the
   `resource_metadata` URL and the `scope` the server requires.
2. Protected resource metadata (RFC 9728) is fetched from the challenge URL.
   Without a challenge the well-known URIs are tried in order: the path-aware
   `https://host/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/<path>` and then the root
   `https://host/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`. A document whose
   `resource` names a different server is rejected.
3. Authorization server metadata is discovered for the first advertised
   authorization server (or the one used by a previous login). For issuers
   with a path component the candidates are
   `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/<path>`,
   `/.well-known/openid-configuration/<path>`, and
   `/<path>/.well-known/openid-configuration`; without a path they are
   `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and
   `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. The document's `issuer` must be
   byte-identical to the issuer used to build the URL.
4. The login refuses to proceed unless `code_challenge_methods_supported`
   contains `S256`.
5. A `client_id` is obtained using the first available mechanism:
   pre-registered credentials from the config, a Client ID Metadata Document
   URL when the authorization server advertises
   `client_id_metadata_document_supported`, a dynamic registration reused
   from the previous login for the same issuer and redirect URI, or a new
   Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) as a native public client. If none
   is available the login fails with instructions to configure
   `oauth.clientId` or `oauth.clientIdMetadataUrl`.
6. Scopes are selected from the challenge `scope`, else the protected
   resource metadata `scopes_supported`, else the configured `oauth.scopes`.
   Previously granted scopes for the same issuer and any additional scopes
   requested for step-up authorization are unioned in. `offline_access` is
   added only when the authorization server advertises it.
7. The browser is opened with `code_challenge`, `state`, `scope`, and the
   canonical server URI as `resource`. On callback the `iss` parameter is
   validated against the recorded issuer before anything else is inspected,
   then `state` is verified and the code is exchanged (again with
   `resource`, and `client_secret` for confidential pre-registered clients).

The token record is written atomically with mode `0600` to
`~/.haskell-agent/credentials/mcp/<hex(url)>.json` and is picked up by
configured remote servers automatically. The wire client refreshes expired
tokens with the stored `resource` and `client_secret`.

## Configuration

Remote servers accept an optional `oauth` object. Every key is optional:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "oauth": {
        "clientId": "pre-registered-client-id",
        "clientSecret": "only-for-confidential-clients",
        "clientIdMetadataUrl": "https://app.example.com/oauth/client-metadata.json",
        "scopes": ["files:read"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `clientId` / `clientSecret`: credentials from a pre-registration with the
  authorization server. They take precedence over every other mechanism. The
  secret is never printed; it is stored in the private token record so token
  refreshes can present it.
- `clientIdMetadataUrl`: an `https` URL with a path that serves a Client ID
  Metadata Document. It is used verbatim as the `client_id` when the
  authorization server supports the mechanism.
- `scopes`: fallback scopes when neither the challenge nor the protected
  resource metadata names any.

## Token record

```json
{
  "client_id": "...",
  "token_endpoint": "https://auth.example.com/token",
  "access_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "expires_at": 1790000000,
  "issuer": "https://auth.example.com",
  "scope": "files:read offline_access",
  "resource": "https://example.com/mcp",
  "client_id_source": "dynamic_registration",
  "client_id_metadata_url": null,
  "client_secret": null,
  "redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:43127/callback"
}
```

The first five keys are the compatibility record used by the wire client;
records written before the remaining keys existed still load. Credentials are
bound to `issuer`: when a later login discovers a different authorization
server the stored client registration and scopes are not reused.

## Library API

`Agent.MCP.OAuth` exposes the pure building blocks so the wire client and
tests share one implementation: `parseWwwAuthenticate` / `challengeScopes`,
`canonicalResourceUri`, `protectedResourceMetadataUrls`,
`authorizationServerMetadataUrls`, `validateIssuer`, `checkPkceSupport`,
`selectClientRegistration`, `selectScopes` / `planScopes`, and
`validateAuthorizationResponseIssuer`, plus the IO discovery and token
endpoint helpers built on them.
