-- Kimi is a drop-in Responses host except that it is stateless:
-- @store@ must be false and @previous_response_id@ is unsupported. ChatGPT-only
-- computer-use tools are dropped; function tools and @web_search@ pass through.
-- Kimi silently ignores unknown tools, so anything else passes through too.
-- @tool_choice: \"none\"@ is rejected by Kimi, so it is dropped (the callers
-- that set it also send an empty tool list, so no tool calls are possible).
