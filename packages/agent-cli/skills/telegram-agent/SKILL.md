# Telegram agent

Use the dedicated `agent-telegram` executable. Do not use a `monad-cli`
Telegram subcommand.

## Security rule

Never ask the user to paste a BotFather token into chat, a prompt, or a tool
argument. Agent conversations and tool calls may be persisted. Secret entry
belongs exclusively to the interactive `agent-telegram setup` command, which
disables terminal echo and stores the token in a private gateway file.

## Setup workflow

1. Explain that the user must open Telegram and message `@BotFather`.
2. Tell them to run `/newbot`, choose the bot name and username, and keep the
   returned token private.
3. Help them obtain their numeric Telegram user ID, for example by messaging
   `@userinfobot`. This ID is an allowlist entry, not a secret.
4. Determine the desired provider and project working directory. The default
   approval mode asks through Telegram inline buttons. Use
   `--deny-mutations` when the user wants a read-only gateway, and only enable
   `--yolo` when the user explicitly requests full auto-approval. If the user
   wants the agent to consider ambient group conversation, add
   `--all-group-messages`. Tell them to disable the bot's group privacy through
   BotFather's `/setprivacy`; the agent will then reply only when useful.
5. Ask the user to run this command in their own interactive terminal:

   ```sh
   agent-telegram setup --provider <provider> --cwd <project> \
     --allowed-user <numeric-id>
   ```

   Repeat `--allowed-user` for multiple users. Add `--model`, `--effort`,
   `--deny-mutations`, or `--yolo` only when requested. The command validates
   the token using Telegram's `getMe` API.
6. Wait until the user confirms setup completed. Do not attempt to pipe or
   inject the token through a shell tool.
7. Start the configured gateway with:

   ```sh
   agent-telegram start
   ```

8. Verify it with:

   ```sh
   agent-telegram status
   ```

9. Tell the user to open their new bot and send `/start`. The bot supports
   `/new` for a fresh agent session, `/session` for the current session ID,
   `/status` for queue/retry state, `/retry` for the latest failed turn, and
   `/allow` / `/deny` / `/users` to manage who may talk to it. To use it in a
   group, an allowlisted Telegram administrator of that group must add the bot.
   If anyone else adds it, the bot leaves. Then mention its `@username`, reply
   to one of its messages, or address commands to it (for example
   `/new@your_bot_username`). Each group or forum topic has a shared agent
   session. Only messages from allowlisted users are accepted; ambient group
   traffic is ignored unless setup used `--all-group-messages`. In that
   mode each allowed-user message is considered, but the agent stays silent
   unless a response would be useful. An already-allowed member can grant
   someone else immediately by asking the bot to accept them, or with `/allow`
   by name, `@username`, or by replying to one of their messages. Text, edited messages, reactions, photos,
   documents, audio, video, video notes, animations, stickers, locations,
   contacts, venues, polls, dice, and voice messages are persisted before
   processing.
   Voice transcription uses the user's existing Codex subscription, so Codex
   must already be logged in on the machine running the gateway.

## Telegram delivery behavior

- The gateway shows typing and a native rich-message draft that streams the
  current answer, available reasoning summaries, and model/tool/retry activity.
- Agent Markdown is converted to Telegram-safe HTML, with a plain-text fallback.
- Group and supergroup responses reply to the triggering message. Forum topics
  are isolated from one another.
- A reply containing exactly one supported Telegram reaction emoji is delivered
  as a reaction to the triggering message instead of as a separate message.
- Inbound reaction changes become ordinary durable agent turns, including
  reaction removals. Group reactions are accepted only for messages recorded
  as bot output.
- Mutating-tool approvals and generic choices use scoped, expiring inline
  buttons. The agent can also send Telegram documents, photos, voice files,
  and reactions through parent-owned gateway tools, and can list, allow, or
  deny Telegram users when an already-allowed person asks it to.
- Transient Telegram and agent failures use bounded backoff and durable retry
  metadata. `/retry` restores the latest dead-lettered turn.
- Voice messages are limited to 10 minutes and 20 MB. They are downloaded to a
  private temporary gateway file, transcribed through `codex app-server`, then
  deleted before the transcript enters the normal durable agent-session path.

## Management

Use `agent-telegram users list|add ID|remove ID` to manage the local allowlist
from the CLI; restart the running gateway after those changes. In chat, `/allow`
and the `allow_telegram_user` tool apply immediately and do not require a
restart. Use `agent-telegram stop` to stop the background gateway. Redacted JSON
logs and durable queue state live below `~/.haskell-agent/gateways/telegram/`.
